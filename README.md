FRIDAY-AI
Virtual Desktop assistant to automate certain tasks

The voice assistant we have developed is a desktop-based built using python modules and libraries. This assistant is just a basic version that could perform all the basic tasks which have been mentioned above but current technology is although good in it is still to be merged with Machine Learning and Internet Of Things(IoT) for better enhancements.

Version 1.5 is loaded with direct google search command and also support from wolfarmalpha API for calculation and for any other queries which is not defined in program.
